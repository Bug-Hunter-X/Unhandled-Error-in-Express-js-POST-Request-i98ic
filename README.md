# Unhandled Error in Express.js POST Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications:  failure to handle missing or invalid request bodies in POST requests.  The application lacks robust error handling and input validation, leading to unexpected behavior and potential crashes.

## Bug Description
The `bug.js` file shows an Express.js server that attempts to create a new user based on data received in a POST request to `/users`.  However, it lacks crucial error handling for scenarios where the request body is empty or malformed.  This can result in unexpected errors, application crashes, or inconsistent responses.

## Bug Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a corrected version with proper error handling and input validation. It checks for the presence of required fields in the request body and handles database errors gracefully, providing informative error messages to the client.

## How to Reproduce the Bug
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `node bug.js` to start the server.
4. Send a POST request to `/users` with a missing or incomplete JSON body.  Observe the unexpected behavior.

## How to Run the Solution
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `node bugSolution.js` to start the server.
4. Send a POST request to `/users` with a missing or incomplete JSON body.  Observe the improved error handling.
